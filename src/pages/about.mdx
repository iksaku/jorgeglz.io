### About Me, Myself and I

My name is Jorge González, also known in the online work as _iksaku_. I was born
in Mexico 🇲🇽 and I like tech-related stuff, food and also sports (not as a
spectator but as a player, even if I'm not the most proficient one).

My sport of choice is Karate 🥋, I've been practicing since I was 7 years old,
and I've got the opportunity to be under the guidance of a lot of excellent
sensei here from Mexico, as well as from Guatemala, Spain and Japan directly.

I'm currently studying a _Software Engineering_ degree, which I hope to finish
around year 2022. To be honest, I don't feel like I'm learning new tech-related
stuff at school, since I've been learning and studying on those lands for quite
some time already, but I'm truly getting better for Math and Physics stuff.
