## About Me, Myself, and I

My name is Jorge González, also known in the online work as _iksaku_.
I was born in Mexico 🇲🇽 and I like tech-related stuff, food and
also sports (not as a spectator but as a player, even if I'm not the
most proficient one).

My sport of choice is Karate 🥋, I've been practicing since I was 7
years old, and I've got the opportunity to be under the guidance of a
lot of excellent sensei here from Mexico, as well as from Guatemala,
Spain and Japan directly.

I finished my <i>Software Engineering</i> degree in 2022, however,
I'm yet to receive the documents regarding this milestone.
<br/>
Regardless of this milestone, I still consider myself a _self-taught
developer_ as I started my _programming journey_ back when I was 13yo.

## Main Programming Languages

* My always loyal [PHP](https://www.php.net/).
* The simple, yet powerful, [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

> By no means this is an exhaustive list, but just the
> ones I enjoy using.

## Personal Facts

* 💍 I'm married.
* 🥋 In Karate, I have got up to Black Belt 1° Dan.
* 📚 I started learning English by myself at the age of 6.
* 🎤 I get to learn the lyrics of many songs, but fail to remember the name of the songs, the bands or the artists.
* 🤢 I don't like onion, garlic nor avocado.
