My name is Jorge Gonz√°lez, also known in the online work as _iksaku_, I like
tech-related stuff, food and also sports (not as a watcher, but as a player,
even if I'm not the most proficient one).

If you're reading this `page` I would assume that you're curious to know more
about me or you just simply came back to check some fact of my own. Whatever
your reasons are, I will try to summarize myself in this page, maybe add one
or two off-topic interesting facts, and write in a selfish way (since this
is about me).
